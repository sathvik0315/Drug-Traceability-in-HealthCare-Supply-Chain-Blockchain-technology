# 🚑 **Drug Traceability Project in pharmaceutical Healthcare Supply Chain Using Blockchain Technology** 🔗

## 🌟 **Overview**
In an era of rapid pharmaceutical advancements, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of drugs is paramount. This project leverages **Blockchain Technology** to enhance the transparency, traceability, and security of the healthcare supply chain. By using a decentralized approach, it ensures that the journey of each drug is tracked from manufacturing to delivery, minimizing the risk of counterfeit products and ensuring compliance with regulations.

## 🎯 **Project Goals**

- 🛠️ **Traceability:** Ensures drugs are traceable from manufacturer to consumer.
- 🔒 **Security:** Prevents counterfeit drugs from entering the supply chain.
- 🌐 **Transparency:** Provides visibility for all stakeholders involved in the supply chain.
- ⏱️ **Efficiency:** Reduces delays and improves overall supply chain management.

## 🖥️ **Technology Stack**
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum Smart Contracts 🏗️
- **Backend:** Python 3.7.4 🐍
- **Web3:** Web3.js and Python Integration 🌍
- **Database:** SQL for transaction logging and data storage 📊
- **Smart Contract Platform:** Truffle Framework 🔨
- **Ethereum Network:** Ganache for local blockchain simulation ⚡

---

## 🚀 **Key Features**
- 📝 **Decentralized Ledger:** Immutable records for each drug's journey, reducing the risk of tampering.
- 🤖 **Smart Contracts:** Automates transactions and enforces rules, ensuring compliance.
- 📡 **Real-Time Monitoring:** Tracks drugs as they move through the supply chain, offering stakeholders up-to-date information.
- 🛡️ **Data Integrity:** Ensures that data on the blockchain cannot be altered, ensuring trust.

## 🔧 **How It Works**
1. **Drug Creation:** 🏭 When a drug is created, a smart contract is deployed on the blockchain.
2. **Supply Chain Movement:** 🚚 As the drug moves through the supply chain (e.g., from manufacturer to distributor, to retailer, and finally to the consumer), every action is recorded on the blockchain.
3. **Transaction Validation:** ✅ Each movement of the drug is validated by the smart contract to ensure that no counterfeit drugs enter the supply chain.
4. **Consumer Access:** 📲 Consumers and stakeholders can verify the authenticity of the drug through a simple scan, ensuring complete traceability.
