## 🎯 **Project Goals**
The primary goal of this project is to build a transparent and secure drug traceability system that operates on blockchain technology. With the growing concerns around the proliferation of counterfeit drugs, this system aims to create an immutable ledger that records each transaction in the drug supply chain, providing stakeholders with real-time access to verified drug information.

- 🛠️ **Traceability:** Ensures drugs are traceable from manufacturer to consumer.
- 🔒 **Security:** Prevents counterfeit drugs from entering the supply chain.
- 🌐 **Transparency:** Provides visibility for all stakeholders involved in the supply chain.
- ⏱️ **Efficiency:** Reduces delays and improves overall supply chain management.

## 🔧 **How It Works**
1. **Drug Creation:** 🏭 When a drug is created, a smart contract is deployed on the blockchain.
2. **Supply Chain Movement:** 🚚 As the drug moves through the supply chain (e.g., from manufacturer to distributor, to retailer, and finally to the consumer), every action is recorded on the blockchain.
3. **Transaction Validation:** ✅ Each movement of the drug is validated by the smart contract to ensure that no counterfeit drugs enter the supply chain.
4. **Consumer Access:** 📲 Consumers and stakeholders can verify the authenticity of the drug through a simple scan, ensuring complete traceability.
